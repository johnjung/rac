<h1>The University of Chicago Library Backgrounder </h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

  <p>
As a center of intense intellectual inquiry, the University of Chicago Library shares with the University of Chicago the aspiration to be the most dynamic learning environment in the world.</p>

<p>The University of Chicago Library provides comprehensive resources and services in support of the research, teaching, and learning needs of the University and broader research community.  Its librarians are committed to understanding the needs of faculty, students and staff and to building and preserving the collections that support these needs. The Library ensures that collections are forward-looking, diverse in breadth and form, open to browsing, and of world-renowned quality.    </p>

<p>The Library helps researchers and students to discover and use local and global information resources in hospitable physical and virtual environments. Librarians develop innovative ways to use new technologies to preserve, locate, and deliver resources—from second-century manuscripts to electronic publications to scientific data sets—to help researchers and students make new discoveries that facilitate their intellectual growth and increase the world’s knowledge.</p>

  <p>University of Chicago librarians advance local, national, and international library and information initiatives and collaborate with University faculty, graduate students, staff, and partners outside the University to enrich the global research and learning community. The Library thrives on diversity and actively develops, encourages and sustains the expertise, skill, commitment and innovative spirit of its staff.</p>
