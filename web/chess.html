 <i>Le Jeu des échecs moralisé (The Moralized Game of Chess) </i>was
written in Latin in the 13th century by Jacobus de Cessolis, an
Italian Dominican friar. Cessolis took advantage of the opportunity to
use a relatively new game, chess, to describe an ideal society through
the medium of the chessboard. Written at a time of political
instability, his work was read centuries later as a guide to proper
behavior, both because of the readily understood nature of the
metaphor and the references to biblical and classical literature that
buttress the argument.  </p>

Each piece and its attributes is thoroughly described; for example, if
the Knight can move in front of a Pawn it is because the role and
responsibility of the Knight is to protect the commoner - who in turn
serves the Knight. Morality is prescribed: the King who leaves his
wife for another acts against nature; the Queen must be chaste,
docile, and concerned with the raising of her sons; the peasant should
respect the laws and serve the lord. Each of the eight Pawns stands
for a group of people, such as innkeepers or doctors and
apothecaries. An intertwined society of mutual obligation is neatly
laid out, as Cessolis says, "talents are distributed so that no one
suffices by himself, but only has value in his relationships with
others."
</p>
<p>
With the focus on societal behavior rather than on the rules of the
game, it would be nearly impossible to learn to play the game of chess
from this text, but it is clear that the rules of medieval chess are
quite different from those in place today. The King, for example, was
restricted in his movement to the first three rows of the board, as it
is his duty to stay close to home and defend the country.
