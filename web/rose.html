<i>Le Roman de la Rose</i>, begun by Guillaume de Lorris ca. 1230 and
completed, in a different style, ca. 1270-80, by Jean de Meun, builds
on the concept of courtly love found in the poetry of the
troubadours. The authors create a complex allegory of the romance
between the Lover and the Rose.  In the quest to pick the Rose (to
achieve the conquest of love), the flower and its attendants represent
the Lady and her sentiments while being wooed.

In the first part of the poem, written by de Lorris, the Lover
recounts his dream, ending with the winning of a kiss from the
Lady. In the dream, the Lover discovers a walled garden and gains
entrance thanks to a beautiful young woman.  He meets Diversion and
dancers who represent courtly values such as Beauty and Generosity.  A
tour of the garden brings him to a beautiful bed of roses by the
Fountain of Love.  Pierced by the arrows of the god of love, he sets
out to pluck the rosebud that has overwhelmed his senses.  Love
explains to the Lover how he ought to conduct himself, and the
conflicting emotions he will feel. With help from Warm Welcome, the
Lover makes his way through the thicket of thorns and confronts Danger
and his allies, Slander, Fear and others.  Aided by Friend, Honesty,
Pity and Venus, he succeeds in overcoming Chastity and obtaining his
desire.

His bliss is short-lived, as the forces of resistance oppose him in
the second part of the poem, written by de Meun. The Lover sets out on
a renewed quest to conquer the heart of his love, whom Jealousy has
imprisoned along with Warm Welcome.  The long and arduous battle is
interspersed with didactic lectures by such figures as Reason.  False
Appearance and Forced Abstinence trick and strangle Slander, thus
entering the wall and freeing Courtesy and Generosity.  The four
confront the old woman guarding Warm Welcome, who advises on table
manners and dress for young women and recommends that they not be
faithful to only one man, as men are by nature untrustworthy.  The
Lover gains admittance to see Warm Welcome, but is confronted with
Danger, Shame and Fear who imprison Welcome ever more securely.
Before those forces can conquer the Lover, he calls his army to assail
the castle with the help of Venus (carnal love).  Venus sets the
castle on fire, causing Danger, Jealousy and her companions to flee.
The battle over, the Lover is able to complete his pilgrimage and at
last pluck the rosebud.

The <i>Roman</i> served as an influential compendium of advice for readers of
its time and was the cause of the first literary "war," which revolved
partly around arguments on the role and dignity of women.
